## Who Am I?
- AI Engineer @ Индикат (2023 - Present)  
- Previously, Software Engineer @ CodeSmith Tech (2021 - 2022)  
- Pursuing M.Sc. in Computer Science so I can have fancy letters after my name  
- Full-time code tinkerer, part-time AI whisperer

I specialize in building Large Language Model projects, but more importantly, in finding out all the ways they can fail. Because real progress happens at the intersection of *Oops* and *Oh!*.

## What I Do
- **AI/ML**: If it involves GPT, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, I’m probably messing around with it.
- **Backend**: Microservices, APIs, and “why is Docker so big?!” crisis management.
- **Computer Vision**: Making machines see, and hopefully not become sentient.  
- **IoT**: Because hooking up random sensors to the internet is always a good idea.

## Project Highlights
- [**Customizable GPT Chatbot**](https://github.com/shamspias/customizable-gpt-chatbot) – Like ChatGPT, but with *your* data (and maybe your bad jokes).
- [**Langchain Chat**](https://github.com/shamspias/langchain-chat) – AI Q&A that tries really hard to be helpful (80% of the time, it works every time).
- [**OpenAI Assistant Python**](https://github.com/shamspias/openai-assistent-python) – Minimalistic approach to using the OpenAI Assistant API... because who needs fancy interfaces?
- [**ChatGPT Voice Chatbot Telegram**](https://github.com/shamspias/chatgpt-voice-chatbot-telegram) – AI that can speak and listen, so you can finally argue with your computer.
- [**Langchain Gemini API**](https://github.com/shamspias/langchain-gemini-api) – Experimenting with Google’s upcoming Gemini for text and image interactions. Because we’re impatient.
- [**VideoLabelMagic**](https://github.com/shamspias/VideoLabelMagic) – Frame extraction + object detection = more time to do anything but manually label videos.
- [**PiSystemStats**](https://github.com/shamspias/PiSystemStats) – Because even your Raspberry Pi wants to flex its CPU stats in real-time.

## Publications
Check out my questionable attempts at academic writing on [**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-7537-9138). I promise I didn’t bribe the reviewers. Much.
